## Uploading your App to the Play Store

In this section I will not go into details of Play Developer Console because the layout and User Interface changes regularly. I will however give you an overview of how to upload your app to the Play Store.

First things first, before you can begin publishing to the Play Store you will have to sign up for a Google Play developer account. You can sign up by going here <https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/>

Uploading your app to the Google Play Store is relatively easy.
After you've signed up for a developer account you down upload your APK using the Play Console <https://play.google.com/apps/publish/>.
