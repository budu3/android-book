# Introduction

The Apple App Store made its debut on
July on the iPhone 2 and has not looked back since[^ftnt]. To say that the App Store
has been a success is an understatement. As of the date of writing
this book the Apple App Store has a record 800 000 apps available
for download. The concept of an "App" and an "App Store" has now
been adopted by a plethora of platforms including, Google (Google
Play), Amazon (Amazon Appstore for Android), Microsoft (Windows
Store), Firefox (Firefox Marketplace), Chrome (Chrome Web Store) and
a host of other platforms. It seems like every device today has an
app Store and for every task out there, there's an App for
that.

In this book we will learn how to create Android WebView Apps. The aim is
to show a novice how to develop simple Web apps for mobile
devices. Before you can develop apps you'll need to know some
basics web technologies. Your app will consist of 3 main
components, HTML5, CSS and Javascript. HTML5 is used for
presentation, CSS is used for styling and Javascript is used to
code the actual functionality of your app.

## HTML5

HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language 5) will be used to create all the visual elements of your app.

## DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is an object representation of the
elements that make up your app. It is organized as a tree. Every
web app consists of a DOM and the functionality of your app
usually involves manipulating the DOM.

We will discuss the aforementioned technologies later on in this
book.

## Native Apps versus Web Apps

Native apps are written specifically for the platform on which
they run on. They take advantage of the platform's native user
interface elements. Web apps on the other hand are developed using
web technologies, can be viewed in a browser and can usually work
on any platform with a compliant browser.
