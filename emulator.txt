# Running your App in the Android Emulator

The Android Emulator is essentially a virtual Android device that runs on your computer. You can use it as an alternative to running your app on a physical device.

The steps below will guide you on how to set up and run the emulator.


1. Click Run
	* In Android Studio to run an app in the emulator you can simply click the Run icon in the toolbar or you can go to Run -\> Run 'app' in the menu bar.
	* The _Select Deployment Target_ dialog box will appear as shown in the figure.

2. Create New Virtual Device
	* Click on the "Create New Virtual Device" button in the _Select Deployment Target_ dialog box.
	* Download a system image. Choose the image that you prefer from the _Select a system image_ screen. I downloaded the _Nougat_ system image.
	* Follow the prompts that will appear.

3. Select Deployment Target
	* Select a device in the _Select Deployment Target_ dialog box and click *OK*. Your app will then open up in the emulator as shown in the figure.

I> During the process of setting up the emulator, Android Studio might prompt you to download certain recommended programs. HAXM (Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) or KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) are examples of this. HAXM and KVM use hardware acceleration to improve the performance of your emulator.
